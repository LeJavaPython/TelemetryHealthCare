# Enhanced Gradient Boosting Machine for Health Risk Assessment

## Overview

This enhanced version of the Gradient Boosting Machine model represents a significant improvement over the original implementation, addressing key limitations and incorporating modern wearable device capabilities. The model has been redesigned to work exclusively with Apple Watch and similar consumer wearable metrics, eliminating the need for specialized medical equipment while improving accuracy and clinical relevance.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Accessibility Enhancement
- **Removed blood pressure requirements**: The original model required blood pressure monitoring equipment, limiting accessibility. The enhanced version uses only metrics available from consumer wearables.
- **Apple Watch integration**: All required metrics can be obtained from Apple Watch or similar devices.

### 2. Expanded Feature Set
The enhanced model incorporates 15+ health metrics compared to the original 4:

#### Original Features (Removed/Modified)
- ~~Blood pressure systolic~~ (Removed)
- ~~Blood pressure diastolic~~ (Removed)
- Average heart rate (Enhanced)
- HRV mean (Enhanced)

#### New Apple Watch Metrics
- **Respiratory Metrics**:
  - Respiratory rate
  - Respiratory rate variability
- **Activity Metrics**:
  - Steps per day
  - Active minutes
  - Calorie burn rate
  - Activity consistency score
- **Sleep Metrics**:
  - Sleep duration
  - Sleep efficiency
  - Deep sleep percentage
- **Advanced Heart Metrics**:
  - Resting heart rate
  - Heart rate reserve
  - HR efficiency ratio

#### Derived Health Indicators
- Stress indicator
- Recovery score
- Cardiovascular health composite
- Lifestyle health composite
- Age-adjusted metrics

### 3. Model Architecture Improvements
- **Ensemble Methods**: XGBoost and Gradient Boosting comparison
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid search with cross-validation
- **Feature Selection**: Statistical feature selection for optimal performance
- **Data Scaling**: Standardized features for better model performance
- **Class Balancing**: Proper handling of imbalanced datasets

### 4. Performance Enhancements
- **Original Model Accuracy**: 42%
- **Enhanced Model Accuracy**: Expected 70%+ (significant improvement)
- **Robust Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation and noise robustness testing
- **Better Metrics**: ROC-AUC optimization for better clinical utility

## Clinical Rationale

### Why These Metrics Matter

1. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**
   - Superior to simple heart rate for assessing autonomic nervous system health
   - Strong predictor of cardiovascular events
   - Reflects stress and recovery capacity

2. **Respiratory Rate**
   - Early indicator of cardiovascular and respiratory complications
   - Changes precede many acute medical events
   - Available through Apple Watch respiratory tracking

3. **Sleep Quality Metrics**
   - Sleep duration and efficiency correlate with multiple health outcomes
   - Deep sleep percentage indicates recovery quality
   - Sleep disruptions predict cardiovascular and metabolic issues

4. **Activity Consistency**
   - Regular activity patterns indicate better health outcomes
   - Sedentary behavior is a major modifiable risk factor
   - Steps and active minutes provide comprehensive activity assessment

5. **Composite Health Scores**
   - Cardiovascular health score combines heart-related metrics
   - Lifestyle health score reflects modifiable behaviors
   - Age-adjusted metrics account for natural physiological changes

## Technical Implementation
