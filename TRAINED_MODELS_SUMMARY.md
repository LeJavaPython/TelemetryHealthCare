## Next Steps for Real Data Integration

### 1. Test with Synthetic Apple Watch Data
Run the test scripts to verify model performance:
```bash
python3 test_improved_model.py  # For SVM
```

### 2. HealthKit Integration
Use the provided `healthkit_data_processor.py` for real data processing.

### 3. Core ML Conversion
Convert models for iOS deployment:
- SVM and GBM: Use coremltools with scikit-learn converter
- Neural Network: Direct conversion supported

### 4. iOS App Integration
Models are ready to be integrated into the Swift app with HealthKit data pipeline.
